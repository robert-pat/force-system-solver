The bug:
I ran problem 4 w/ the code the vertical pin force at 180 deg instead of 90, this gave an un-invertible matrix
in solving. (The first solver output below). When I changed this to 90 deg (matches my hand drawing), it then
worked & spit out the correct answers. I don't know why, because it should not matter what the direction of the
force is--the signs of some number would just be flipped. The successful run is the second output below.
