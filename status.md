To Do List:
1) Finalize how points are described
2) Design error system for the parser
3) Finish the format for problems in the TOML
4) Members from TOML
5) Loads in TOML
6) Supports in TOML
7) Invoke from commandline / pass target file at startup
8) Error type / design for the solver
9) Avoid using dependent equations in the matrix
10) Recover from a singular matrix
11) Ensure that each unknown appears in at least one equation


In the future:
- Add relative positioning for points (maybe)
- Move panics + eprintln!() to the error type
- Good feedback / error messages for processing programs
- program startup / user experience
